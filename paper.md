#Introduction
Binding to DNA increases after stress

Receptor binding was measured using ChIP (Reul et al., 2016).
RNA was measured by qPCR showing elevated expression following chronic stress (Carter et al., 2016).
Glucocorticoid receptor binding has been implicated in many stress related neuropsychiatric disorders. 

#Simulations

We simulate the binding of MRs and GRs to GREs within DNA in the hippocampus following chronic restraint stress for 9 weeks.
